## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-11

**Self-Play & Data Pipeline — Plan 4 complete.**

### Added
- Python MCTS implementation: PUCT selection, Dirichlet noise, temperature selection (`training/mcts.py`)
- Self-play game generation: temperature schedule, resign logic, WDL labeling (`training/selfplay.py`)
- Full RL training loop: generate -> train -> export -> repeat with sliding window (`training/selfplay.py`)
- Position history encoding: `encode_board()` fills 8 time steps from move stack (`training/encoder.py`)
- Move bridge: `chess_move_to_policy_index()` maps python-chess moves to 1858-dim encoding
- LR scheduling: `MultiStepLR` support in training loop
- CLI: `python -m training.selfplay generate` and `python -m training.selfplay loop`
- Integration tests: self-play -> train end-to-end, GPU self-play

### Changed
- Value head returns raw logits (previously applied softmax in model)
- Value loss uses `log_softmax` for numerical stability (previously `log(softmax + eps)`)
- `compute_loss` returns `(total, policy, value)` tuple for split loss logging
- TorchScript export applies softmax wrapper for value head
- Training loop logs policy and value loss separately

### Dependencies
- Added: `python-chess` for self-play move generation

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11

**Neural Network & Training Pipeline — Plan 3 complete.**

### Added
- Neural network architecture: SE-ResNet with 10 residual blocks, 128 filters, ~13M params (`training/model.py`)
- Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks: Leela-style with multiplicative weights and additive biases
- Policy head: 1×1 conv → 80 channels → FC → 1858 move logits
- WDL value head: 1×1 conv → 32 channels → FC(128) → FC(3) → softmax
- Position encoder: FEN → 112×8×8 tensor with board flipping for black (`training/encoder.py`)
- Move encoder: 1858-dim policy index ↔ chess move mapping, Leela-style 64×73 (`training/encoder.py`)
- Training loop: policy cross-entropy + value cross-entropy + AdamW weight decay (`training/train.py`)
- TorchScript export for C++ inference via torch.jit.trace (`training/export.py`)
- Synthetic data generator for pipeline testing (`training/generate_data.py`)
- Chess training dataset loader for .npz files (`training/dataset.py`)
- NetworkConfig dataclass for model hyperparameters (`training/config.py`)
- Training test suite: 32 tests covering encoding, model, training, export, end-to-end pipeline

### Validated
- End-to-end pipeline: generate synthetic data → train → export TorchScript → reload and verify
- GPU training on RTX 3080 (CUDA 12.6)
- Loss decreases over training steps (policy CE + value CE)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-11

**MCTS Search Engine — Plan 2 complete.** Merged via [PR #2](https://github.com/drewfoos/chess-ai/pull/2).

### Added
- MCTS tree search: `Node` struct with visit count, value, prior, children (`src/mcts/node.h/cpp`)
- MCTS search loop: select (PUCT) → expand → evaluate → backpropagate (`src/mcts/search.h/cpp`)
- `Evaluator` interface for pluggable position evaluation
- `RandomEvaluator`: uniform policy + material-based value (stub for neural network)
- Dirichlet noise at root for exploration diversity
- Temperature-based move selection for self-play
- First Play Urgency (FPU) reduction at root and non-root nodes
- CLI `search` command: `chess_engine search [fen] [iterations]`
- MCTS test suite: 19 tests covering node operations, PUCT, search, and edge cases

### Validated
- Solves back rank mate, knight forks, Scholar's mate, free captures
- Correctly handles checkmate, stalemate, single legal move positions

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-11

**Chess Engine Core — Plan 1 complete.** Merged via [PR #1](https://github.com/drewfoos/chess-ai/pull/1).

### Added
- Core types: `Square`, `Move`, `Bitboard`, `Color`, `PieceType`, `CastlingRight` (`src/core/types.h`)
- Bitboard utilities: `popcount`, `lsb`, `pop_lsb`, directional shifts with wrapping prevention (`src/core/bitboard.h/cpp`)
- Attack tables: precomputed knight/king/pawn, ray-based bishop/rook/queen (`src/core/attacks.h/cpp`)
- Position class: FEN parsing/serialization, make/unmake move, attack/check detection (`src/core/position.h/cpp`)
- Full legal move generation: all piece types, castling, en passant, promotions (`src/core/movegen.h/cpp`)
- Perft validation: 5 standard positions at multiple depths — 77 tests, all passing (`tests/test_perft.cpp`)
- Perft divide CLI for debugging move generation (`src/main.cpp`)
- CMake build system with Google Test via FetchContent (`CMakeLists.txt`)
- System architecture document (`docs/architecture.md`)
- Technical reference: How AlphaZero Engines Work (`docs/how-alphazero-engines-work.md`)

### Performance
- Starting position perft(5) = 4,865,609 nodes in 0.18s (~27M nodes/sec)

### Infrastructure
- CMake 4.3.1, CUDA Toolkit 12.6, PyTorch 2.11.0+cu126 installed
- GitHub repository: drewfoos/chess-ai
